# Rune Game Engine

Rune is an open source, 2D and 3D game engine written in pure C. The engine is
designed to give the developer as much flexibility as possible in project
layout, as the engine is designed to be "just another sysetm library." There's
no bloated and complex editor or special requirements for your game, other than
what you choose to use and bring to the table.

Rune is licensed under the terms of the zlib license and is fully
community-driven. All development is done on the main mailing list located at
[this link](https://lists.gymli.org/rune-engine). The project loosely follows
the community and development model of the Linux kernel and other large
projects. See the development process documentation in `doc` to get involved.

For bug reporting, there is a bug tracker
[here](https://bugs.gymli.org/index.php?project=3&do=index&switch=1).
