# Rune Game Engine

Rune is an open source (ZLib license), fully 3D game engine written in pure C.
The engine is designed to give the programmer as much flexibility as possible in
project layout, as the engine is designed to be just another system library.

## Contributing

Rune is hosted at https://www.gymli.org/ and all development is done on the
[mailing list](https://lists.gymli.org/rune-engine). The project loosely follows
the development model of the Linux kernel and other similar projects. Volunteers
who wish to contribute should see the relevant documentation in the `doc`
directory and submit patches via email, rather than attempt to perform
Github-style pull requests.
