Development process
===================

This document is intended to provide developers work with the development
community while minimizing frustration. While there are some technical
information here, the majority of this manual is process-oriented and does not
require deep understanding of the engine's APIs to understand.

How to contribute
-----------------

The Rune Engine is free and open source. Like any community-driven project, the
engine relies on volunteer contributions. If you are not a programmer, no need
to worry, as Rune requires many other roles as well. In fact, if you are a user
of the engine and enjoy its feature set, merely putting "Made with Rune" on your
game or application positively impacts the well-being of this project. Your
personal success makes the engine visible to other developers, growing the
community further.

Technical contributions
-----------------------

* Report bugs and other issues - As active users of the engine, you are much
  better equipped to track down bugs and other issues more than anyone else. To
  let the community know about your findings, visit the
  `Flyspray instance <https://bugs.gymli.org/index.php?do=toplevel&project=3>`_.
* Test development versions - It is recommended to use the stable releases for
  your projects, but you can help us test development releases, betas and
  release candidates by running your project with them and checking what
  problems this introduces or solves.
* Contribute engine code - The engine development is mainly coordinated on our
  `mailing list <https://lists.gymli.org/rune-engine/new.html>`_.
* Review code contributions - All patches submitted to the mailing lists need to
  be carefully reviewed before they can be merged into the mainline engine. The
  maintainers are limited in number and how much work they can get done. You can
  help them get a head start by participating in the code review process.
* Demo projects - The engine has a small selection of demo projects so new users
  can quickly test new features or get familiar with the engine in the first
  place. Help improve existing projects or write entirely new ones to be added
  to the pool.
* Write documentation - The documentation is one of the most important parts of
  the engine, and is often overlooked. If you have technical writing skills,
  help with the engine documentation is always welcome.
